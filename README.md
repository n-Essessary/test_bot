Arbitrage Bot

⚡ Arbitrage Bot is a bot for triangular arbitrage on cryptocurrency exchanges. The project focuses on quickly calculating arbitrage opportunities and placing orders to execute them.

Created with the help of Chat GPT, without real coding experience

🚀 Features
	•	Real-time connection to exchange tickers (currently OKX)
	•	Search for triangular arbitrage opportunities based on specified parameters (pairs/spread size/order book volume)
	•	Filtering of illiquid pairs
	•	Placing orders and monitoring their execution via private API

The bot is implemented as a Python script. To run it, simply use a Python interpreter and create a file named api_keys.txt, then insert your exchange API key, secret, and passphrase line by line, like this:
api_key
api_secret
passphrase
